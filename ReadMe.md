# <span style="color:orange">React Portfolio</span> - <span style="color:green">My Library of Coding</span>

### **Description:**

Being a web developer means being part of a community. Youâ€™ll need a place not only to share your projects while you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share your work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

Using new and bright technology like React we want to display our goals, accomplishments, and skills in a simple single-page application for potential employers to see. Our page consists of a deployed React portfolio of work samples, including a link to the corresponding GitHub or deployed application as well as a preview Snippet of the app. Our React app contains three major componants presented to the user including the Header, Body, and Footer.
