            Hi my name is Cray Smith! I'm currently a student at DU under the
            Full-Stack Flex program nearing the end of the course. I'm excited
            to learn all I can and create something new and exciting! Moving
            forward my goal is to continue to challenge myself by learning new
            technologies and improving on the knowledge I've gained thus far. In
            addition to looking to the future I plan to build on the foundations
            I've developed at DU and the knowledge gained throughout my
            education. As a Junior Developer I want to gain reliable real-world
            experience in a challenging and thriving environment while building
            on the tools and techniques I've learned so far. My goal for the
            future is to establish a position in Coding and Development with a
            Career and Team driven company where I can gain real-world
            experience, and use new technologies all in a thriving and
            challenging work environment.

            you like? Select it to see when and where people are playing,
            running, dancing, etc. Have a group you would like to invite people
            to? Create a posting of your own to let people know where they can
            find people like you with their same interests. We encourage
            everyone to be friendly, take pictures, and tag us @milehi_denver on

            What is a regular expression? Regular expressions often refered to
            as "REGEX" are most often a sequence of characters used to define a
            search pattern within a body of text. Regular Expressions use a
            combination of "Literal" characters as well as "Meta" characters,
            these combined can be used to define highly complicated and fexible
            search patterns.

            Tasked too optimize and refactor Horiseon's webpage and code for an
            upcomming product launch that is expected to increase their userbase
            and create more travel on their site. In addition we will be
            replacing non-semantic code with semantic-elements to make the
            database cleaner, easier to read, and easier to edit in the future.
            At the end of this project our goal is to present a BETTER
            experience for Horiseon's growing userbase though a stream lined
            wedpage with a familiar look we all know and love.

            Welcome to eShopper! Our goal is to provide a simple, small, and

            Read, Update, and Delete). In addition to those great tools our
            Express.js Api uses dotenv to store sensitive data, like a user's
            MySQL username, password, and database name, using it's environment
            variables.
